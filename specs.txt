To make a game, you need these things:
  > a path set in Location that points to a directory of Place scenes (or images), each representing a location in your game
    > which can contain TalkThings and GrabThings and link to each other with GoThings;
  > a path set in Stuff that points to a directory of images, each representing an inventory item;
  > and an Ink script loaded into InkPlayer.
